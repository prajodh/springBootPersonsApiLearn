# Legacy API Modernization with Spring Boot

This project modernizes a legacy system by converting outdated CRUD APIs into modern, maintainable Spring Boot RESTful services. It implements the MVC architecture pattern and includes interactive API documentation using Swagger UI. The backend originally relied on a relational database (SQL), and was later migrated to a NoSQL model using Azure Cosmos DB, guided through AI-assisted prompt engineering.
